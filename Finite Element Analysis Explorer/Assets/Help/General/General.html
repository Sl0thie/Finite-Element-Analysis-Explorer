    <h1>General Help</h1>
    <p>This is my first Universal App so please excuse me as I absolutely murder the MVVM pattern. (<a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Model%E2%80%93view%E2%80%93viewmodel" target="_blank">Model View ViewModel</a>)</p>
    <p>The purpose of this App is to provide a graphical view of static analysis calculations used to determine properties such as stress within structural components. (Members) The App is far from finished so there is only a quickstart avalible at the moment.</p>
