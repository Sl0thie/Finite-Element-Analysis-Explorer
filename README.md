# Finite-Element-Analysis-Explorer

Finite Element Analysis Explorer (FEA Explorer) is an application that is designed to find structural analysis solutions using Finite Element Methods (FEM). 
Its the first Universal Windows Platform application to provide a finite element solution. 
Solutions are presented in a graphical display that provides variable scales for all the supported force types as well as the reactions. 
The resulting displacements can also be scaled to highlight the resulting movements of the elements.
