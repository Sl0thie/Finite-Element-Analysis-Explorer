# Finite-Element-Analysis-Explorer

Finite Element Analysis Explorer (FEA Explorer) is an application that is designed to find structural analysis solutions using Finite Element Methods (FEM). 
Its the first Universal Windows Platform application to provide a finite element solution. 
Solutions are presented in a graphical display that provides variable scales for all the supported force types as well as the reactions. 
The resulting displacements can also be scaled to highlight the resulting movements of the elements.

Many standard materials are included and modifying or creating new ones can be easily achieved using the materials user interface. Many of the material properties can be modified and the other properties will be updated to suit the changes that are made.

Results of the models show the applied forces and reactions. Compession and tension are displayed in varing colors on the members to display the most stressed members and those that are carrying no loads at all are white.
